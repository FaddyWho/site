                  <p>
                    Snippets is a supplementary language learning app, with a focus on vocabulary. It uses augmented reality and artificial intelligence to help users identify objects in their proximity and learn the the words for it.
Users can also contribute to the vocabulary database by tagging objects in the language they know and review tags contributed by other users to help expand the vocabulary database and improve the AI recognition.

                    Learning vocabulary is difficult and users often lose interest in standardised courses which aren't catered to their lifestyle and needs.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="port-text">
          <h4>Language preservation</h4>
          <p>The idea for a language learning app started with the realization that regional languages and dialects are slowly fading away. While modernization gives us many benefits, it also takes away the intricacies of regional culture are overtaken by a unified metropolitan society. This is clearly evident in Pakistani society where learning English takes precedence over mastering your own mother tongue, many people cannot speak Urdu or Sindhi without interjecting borrowed words from English where there is no need to.</p>
          <p>To preserve and promote regional languages and dialects, and allow people to easily learn them I decided to create Snippets. Which would take advantage of AI and also help solve the problems it faces.</p>
          <h4>Shortcomings of Artificial Intelligence</h4>
          <p>Large language models, currently face an array of problems which causes it to output false information, or have a lack of contextual understanding. This is caused by a variety of factors including but not limited to;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bias in training data</li>
            <li>Limited real-time knowledge</li>
            <li>Lack of niche or specialized data</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Snippets was built to solve these two problems simultaneously. Where documenting language would also help improve AI in a way that they compliment each other.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Research and Insights</h2>
        <div class="port-text">
          <h4>Understanding the Users</h4>
          <p>
            As part of the user research process, I conducted surveys to
            identify common challenges in language learning, gaining insights
            into the difficulties learners face. Additionally, I analyzed
            existing language learning apps to pinpoint gaps and areas for
            improvement. To further refine the research, I interviewed language
            learners to understand their preferences, needs, and expectations,
            ensuring that the findings were user-centered and actionable.
          </p>
          <h4>Key Findings</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Users found visual and contextual learning more effective than
              rote memorization.
            </li>
            <li>
              There was a strong interest in gamification and community-driven
              learning.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many users struggled with retaining vocabulary not used in daily
              life.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Competitive analysis</h4>
          <p>A competitive analysis of language learning apps revealed same issues that were mentioned in the survey and the interviews. The apps follow a standardized course, teaching vocabulary that is often irrelevant to the users' current context. Similarly, they often keep focus of the users on the screen, where lessons get blurred together. While they use graphics and gamification elements, they still lack any social features to connect users to fellow learners.</p>
          <p>This prompted me to try a different approach to helping users learn vocabulary, where these issues are addressed and solved using two learning strategies, namely proximity learning, and spatial mnemonics.</p>

              <h5>Proximity Learning</h5>
              <p>
                Contrary to a standard course, the app would focus on teaching words
                for objects that users find around themselves and interact with
                on a daily bases, similar to a child who learns words as they
                become important in their lives and will be used recurringly.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5>Spatial Mnemonics</h5>
              <p>
                The app would display the name of the object in augmented reality on
                top of the object seen through the phone, this engages user's
                spatial memory and the names can be easily recalled while seeing
                the object in real life similar to Method of loci. This idea is

            Based on these findings, Snippets was built with the following
            guiding principles:
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Context-based learning: Users learn words that are immediately
              useful in their lives.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spatial Mnemonics: User retain words better associated in physical
              space rather than a flat screen, augmented reality can be used to
              achieve this.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gamification elements: Users earn points for learning, tagging,
              and reviewing objects.
            </li>
            <li>
              Community-driven approach: The database grows through user
              contributions, and allows them to connect with fellow learners.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

            The app was designed to function in a feedback loop, where users
            earn points by tagging objects and reviewing contributions. Which in turn teaches learners said language processed through the large language model. This enhances the AI's accuracy.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Object Recognition via AI: Users scan objects with their camera,
              and the AI suggests the corresponding word in language they are trying to learn.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tagging & Reviewing: Users can contribute new words or validate
              existing ones to maintain accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Points System: Users earn and spend points by using either of the previous features, maintaining a balance of contribution and learning.

          <p>Developing the Augmented Reality navigation and interaction was the most interesting aspect of designing for the app. The view through the app can be unpredictable, with multiple objects simultaneously visible in the surrounding of the object, as well as objects being defined in a way that is similar to a russian doll. Every object is made up of smaller objects, which is why it was necessary to create a way focus an object, and then go through its inner selection. This all depends on the view scale of the camera as well. </p>

        <h2>Learning and Takeaways</h2>
        <div class="port-text">
          <h5>Critical Number of Users.</h5>
          <p>Vocabulary expansion may initially favor regions with high user numbers, taking over smaller 
            dialects and reflecting the problems diversity of regional languages faces in real life. </p>
            <p>Region-based language selection would allow information to be easily categorized, and 
              languages with smaller user bases should be given extra support so that more learners can join 
              and reach a critical number of users. </p>
          <h5>Relying on User Generated Data.</h5>
          <p>Quality and diversity of vocabulary relies on active and accurate user participation, allowing the 
            possibility of misuse and false information being spread among users. </p>
            <p>Moderation would be required so only correct information is shared, and a reputation-based 
              score could be implemented that would discourage misuse and allow users to earn a good 
              standing in the community. </p>
          <h5>AR accessibility and Alternatives</h5>
          <p>Feasibility of of AR navigation is untested and would require developmental input. It can also be challenging for new and non-tech-savvy users, making it harder 
            for the app to reach critical user numbers which it heavily relies on. This would also exclude 
            users with older and less powerful devices, exacerbating the problem further. </p>
          <p>Alternative ways to interact with the app would allow a variety of users to engage with it easily, 
            such as picture-based submissions, solving both the non-tech-savvy user and older device 
            problem simultaneously.</p>
